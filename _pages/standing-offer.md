Here's my offer to you in case there's no pandemic out there.


If you are going to be anywhere near where I live, where I work or where I might
be at some point and want to talk about technology or data or startups or
anything really, I'd love to buy you a coffee and have a chat.

I live in a small village near Plovdiv, Bulgaria, but you can find me on many
conferences I attend or organize in Bulgaria. The best way to got get my
attention, though is to [drop me an email]({{ 'contact' | absolute_url }}).
